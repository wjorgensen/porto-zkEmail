npm test-connection  # If available, or start the server
```

## Common Issues

### "Invalid credentials"
- Make sure you're using App Password, not regular password
- Remove all spaces from the app password
- Check that 2FA is enabled

### "IMAP connection failed"
- Verify IMAP is enabled in Gmail settings
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 993
- Try: `telnet imap.gmail.com 993`

### "Cannot send email"
- Gmail has daily limits (500 emails/day)
- Check spam folder
- Verify sender matches GMAIL_USER

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit .env to git** - It's in .gitignore
2. **Use dedicated email** - Don't use personal Gmail
3. **Rotate app passwords** - Regenerate periodically
4. **Monitor access** - Check Google Account activity
