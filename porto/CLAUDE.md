# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for Porto

This file provides essential information for Claude AI (and other AI assistants) working with the Porto codebase.

## Mandatory GitHub Interaction Rules

### Required Tools

1. **GitHub MCP**: `mcp__github__*` functions (authenticated, no rate limits)
2. **GitHub CLI**: `gh` commands (authenticated via CLI)
3. **NEVER**: Direct API calls, web scraping, or unauthenticated requests

### Examples

✅ **Correct**: `mcp__github__get_pull_request` or `gh pr view`
❌ **Wrong**: Direct API calls to `api.github.com`

### Pull Requests

- You are allowed to open pull requests for this repository.
- Always use `mcp__github__create_pull_request` or `gh pr create` to create pull requests.

## Directory Structure

- `apps/`: Applications
- `contracts/`: Contracts
  - The Porto Account contracts are a submodule under the `account/` directory

  - Files are represented as modules
  - Files (modules) that are not exposed to the public API are stored in an `internal/` directory
- `scripts/`: Development scripts
- `test/`: Test configuration and utilities

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**: Against `main`, named `claude/feature-name`
2. **Develop features**: Ensure to add any relevant tests for new functionality
3. **Run tests**: `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:browser`
4. **Check code quality**: `pnpm check`
5. **Build and validate**: `pnpm build && pnpm check:build`
6. **Add changeset**: If any public API or behavioral changes were made to the library (`src/`), add a changeset with `pnpm changeset`. Changesets should use past tense verbs (e.g. `Added new feature`). Any breaking changes should be noted with a `**Breaking:**` prefix with a description of how to migrate.
7. **Submit a PR**: Ensure PR title is in conventional commit format (e.g. `feat: add new feature`) and PR description is detailed

### Tests

- You must run tests with `pnpm test:ci`.
- Test file structure must have `describe` blocks that are 1:1 with module exports.
- Favor `test` over `it`.
- Lowercase `test` descriptions (e.g. `test('behavior: with foo')`)
- `test` descriptions should be prefixed with category
  - `test('behavior: ...')`: Behavioral tests
  - `test('error: ...')`: Error tests
  - `test('param: ...')`: Parameter validation tests
  - `test('misc: ...')`: Miscellaneous tests (doesn't fit into above categories)
- Don't use "should" in test descriptions, just use the verb.
- Tests must be sorted as such:
  - `test('param: ...')`
  - `test('behavior: ...')`
  - `test('error: ...')`
  - `test('misc: ...')`
- Tests must prefer inline snapshots (`expect(foo).toMatchInlineSnapshot()`) over direct assertions.
- For testing multiple similar cases, use `test.each()` instead of loops or repeated test blocks:

  ```typescript
  test.each([
    { input: 'case1', expected: 'result1' },
    { input: 'case2', expected: 'result2' },
  ])('behavior: handles $input', ({ input, expected }) => {
    const result = myFunction(input)
    expect(result).toBe(expected)
  })
  ```

- For encoding tests, use `Schema.encodeSync()` directly instead of `decodeUnknownSync -> encodeSync`:

  ```typescript
  // ✅ Good: Test encoding directly
  test('behavior: encodes BigInt to hex', () => {
    const encoded = Schema.encodeSync(MySchema)({ value: 255n })
    expect(encoded).toEqual({ value: '0xff' })
  })
  
  // ❌ Bad: Unnecessary decode step
  test('behavior: encodes BigInt to hex', () => {
    const decoded = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(MySchema)({ value: '0xff' })
    const encoded = Schema.encodeSync(MySchema)(decoded)
    expect(encoded).toEqual({ value: '0xff' })
  })
  ```

### PR Requirements

- All tests must pass (`pnpm test && pnpm test:browser`)
- Code must be properly formatted (`pnpm check`)
- Types must be valid (`pnpm check:types`)
- Build must succeed (`pnpm build`)
- Bundle size limits must be respected (`pnpm check:size`)
- No unused dependencies (`pnpm check:knip`)

## Documentation Writing Style

When writing or editing documentation files, follow these style guidelines:

### Voice and Perspective

#### Use Third Person for Technical Documentation

- ✅ "The Porto SDK is a TypeScript library designed for Applications and Wallets"
- ✅ "Porto can be used in conjunction with Wagmi"
- ✅ "This will internally inject a Porto instance"
- ❌ "We designed Porto to..." or "Our SDK allows you to..."

#### Use Second Person for Instructions

When giving direct instructions to developers, use second person:

- ✅ "You can get started with Porto by creating a new instance"
- ✅ "After you have set up Wagmi, you can set up Porto"

#### Avoid First Person

Never use "we," "our," or "I" in technical documentation:

- ❌ "We implemented it, ran it for weeks..."
- ✅ "PREP was implemented and ran for a number of weeks"
- ❌ "we don't want to think about it"
- ✅ "this adds unnecessary complexity"
- ❌ "We do not really care about..."
- ✅ "The provable resource-lock capabilities are not prioritized..."

### Examples

**Before (First Person):**

```markdown
We implemented PREP and ran it for weeks, evaluated the pros/cons and we didn't think it was worth it. We replaced it with an ephemeral private key approach.
```

**After (Third Person):**

```markdown
PREP was implemented and ran for a number of weeks. After evaluating the pros/cons, it was decided that the pattern did not meet the needs of the Porto Stack. It was replaced with an ephemeral private key approach.
```

### Writing Changelog Entries

When writing changelog entries, follow these guidelines:

- Sentences lead with verbs such as “Customize…”, “Automatically route…”, “Build and deploy…”, “Click on…”. This keeps the copy action-oriented and user-focused.
- Larger narrative intros use “we” (“Today, we’re launching Porto…”) while instruction paragraphs pivot to second person (“You’ll see your own personalized feed…”). The mix is friendly yet authoritative.
- Each feature gets 1-3 tight paragraphs that start with the user benefit before diving into detail. Jargon is kept product-specific and is usually explained in one line (e.g., “hybrid semantic search combines AI vector embeddings with keyword matching”).
- Big releases open with a bit of storytelling or a rhetorical setup (e.g., “Every product has bugs. More than we can ever fix… Polishing Season is about turning that ‘someday’ into ‘today’”). These break the terseness and add personality.
- Present tense dominates; sentences are short, rarely exceed two clauses.

#### Additional Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Maintain technical accuracy while improving readability
- Reference specific code with inline formatting or code blocks
- Include relevant file paths and line numbers when applicable
- Use passive voice when appropriate to maintain objectivity

## PR Review Comments

- @claude should **Always wrap PR review comments in `<details>` tags**
- Use descriptive summary text in the `<summary>` tag
- This improves PR browsability by allowing users to easily scan through activity without long review comments cluttering the view

Example format:

```html
<details>
<summary>🔍 Code Review: [Brief description]</summary>

[Your detailed review comments here]

</details>
```

This file should be updated when major architectural changes are made to the codebase.
