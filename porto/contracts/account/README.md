**All-in-one EIP-7702 powered account contract, coupled with [Porto](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto)**

Every app needs an account, traditionally requiring separate services for auth, payments, and recovery. Doing this in a way that empowers users with control over their funds and their data is the core challenge of the crypto space. While crypto wallets have made great strides, users still face a fragmented experience - juggling private keys, managing account balances across networks,
having to install browser extensions, and more.

We believe that unstoppable crypto-powered accounts should be excellent throughout a user's journey:

- **Onboarding**: No key management using WebAuthn and Passkeys. KYC-less fiat onramping. No kicking of the user to 3rd party applications, fully embedded experience with headless wallet.
- **Verifying their identity**: Privacy-preserving identity verification with [ZK Passport](https://www.openpassport.app/) or other techniques.
- **Transacting safely**: Access [control policies](src/GuardedExecutor.sol) baked in with sensible defaults in smart contracts.
- **Transacting privately**: Built-in privacy using [stealth addresses](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html) and [confidential transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4491).
- **Transacting seamlessly across chains**: Single address with automatic gas handling across chains using [ERC7683](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7683).
- **Recovering their account**: Multi-path recovery via social, [email](https://github.com/zkemail), [OAuth](https://github.com/olehmisar/zklogin/pull/2), or other identity providers.
- **No vendor lock-in**: No vendor lock-in, built on top of standards that have powered Ethereum for years.
