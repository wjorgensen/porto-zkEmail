# `wallet_prepareCalls`

Prepares a call bundle. The calls are simulated and a quote for executing the bundle by the server is provided. The quote lives for a certain amount of time, after which it expires.

:::tip
This method is intended to be used in conjunction with [`wallet_sendPreparedCalls`](/rpc-server/wallet_sendPreparedCalls).
:::

## PreCalls

PreCalls are calls that are executed prior to pre-verification of the signature of the bundle, and before any payment is made.

Only certain types of calls are allowed in precalls:

- Authorizing a key (`Delegation.authorize`)
- Revoking a key (`Delegation.revoke`)
- Setting call permissions on a key (`Delegation.setCanExecute`)
- Setting spend limits on a key (`Delegation.setSpendLimit`)
- Removing spend limits on keys (`Delegation.removeSpendLimit`)
- Upgrading the delegation (`Delegation.upgradeProxyDelegation`)

 PreCalls have their own signatures, and they must be signed with a key that is already attached to the account. The `from` and `key` fields can be omitted when building a precall (`precall: true`).

More details about preCalls can be found [in the Orchestrator documentation](/contracts/orchestrator#precalls)

## Request

The request consists of:

- A set of calls (`calls`)
- The sender of the intent (`from`)
- Optional supported capabilities, such as key additions (`capabilities.authorizeKeys`), key revocations (`capabilities.revokeKeys`), and precalls (`capabilities.preCalls`).

The fee token the user wishes to pay for execution of the intent is specified in `capabilities.meta.feeToken`. It is also possible to specify a nonce here. If no nonce is specified, the latest on-chain nonce for the EOA will be used.

The key the user wishes to sign the intent with is specified in `key`.

      prehash: boolean,
    },
  }],
}
```

## Response

The response is primarily a `context` object which can either be: a quote, which is the price at which the RPC server will execute the intent for, with a deadline; or a built precall, in case `wallet_prepareCalls` was called to build a precall.

The user should sign `digest` with a key associated with their account. The signed digest and the `context` is then passed to [`wallet_sendPreparedCalls`], if the user wants the RPC server to execute the intent.

The payment fields in `context.quote.op` that are relevant to figure out what the user will pay are:

- `prePaymentAmount`/`prePaymentMaxAmount`: fees the user will pay before the intent is executed
- `totalPaymentAmount`/`totalPaymentMaxAmount`: the maximum fees the user will pay

If `totalPaymentAmount - prePaymentAmount` is non-0, the remainder of the fees will be paid after the intent is executed.
