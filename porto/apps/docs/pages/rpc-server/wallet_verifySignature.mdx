# `wallet_verifySignature`

The validity of the signature is returned along with a proof that can be executed using e.g. `eth_call`.

:::note
It is only possible to validate signatures for admin keys.

## Request

```ts
type Request = {
  // id of the key to verify the signature with or an address of an account.
  // If address is specified, signature will be attempted to verify against
  // all of account keys until a match is found.
  keyIdOrAddress: `0x${string}`,
  // digest of the message to verify
  digest: `0x${string}`,
  // signature bytes
  signature: `0x${string}`,
  chainId: `0x${string}`,
}
````

## Response

```ts
type Response = {
  valid: boolean,
  proof?: {
    // address of an account (either delegated or stored) that the signature was verified against.
    account: `0x${string}`,
    // the key hash that signed the digest.
    keyHash: `0x${string}`,
  }
}
```

## Verification

Signature is always verified against an account (either deployed or stored in RPC storage).
`account` contains the account address the signature was verified against.

To verify that provided account is indeed tied to the provided `keyId`, user can either

1. Query the `AccountRegistry` contract.
2. Verify the returned `idSignature`. It is only returned for accounts that are not yet delegated.

To verify that the signature is valid for the returned account, user can call
`unwrapAndValidateSignature` on the returned account.
