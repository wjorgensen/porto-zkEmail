## Keys

There exists three different key roles:

- **Admin keys** are capable of adding and modifying other keys, and capable of spending an unlimited amount of tokens and calling any contract and selector.
- **Normal keys** can only call contracts as defined by the permissions set on it, and spend the amount of tokens afforded to it by permissions.
- **Session keys** are like normal keys, except they also have an expiry.

Setting permissions on an admin key is not allowed and will return an error.

For complete details on keys, including their signature encoding, public key encoding, and key hashes, refer to the [Key section](/contracts/account#keys).
