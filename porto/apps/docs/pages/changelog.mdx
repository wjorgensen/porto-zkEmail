## Email Support & Removal of PREP

<ChangelogDate date="2025-06-20" />

:::warning
This release will require you to recreate your testnet account with Porto. We've made fundamental improvements that ensure smoother upgrades in the future. Don't worry, these types of breaking upgrades will not occur in production.

  <img className="w-[300px]" src="/email-signup.png" alt="Email Signup" />
</div>

Porto now **optionally** captures email addresses during sign-up to build more connected experiences.
Provide your email during onboarding to streamline Porto's upcoming onramp integration that requires email
verification, and enable the ability to recover your account via email in the future.

Porto automatically handles email verification with secure links sent to your inbox.
Your email address becomes part of your passkey naming strategy, making your accounts more discoverable
and user-friendly across devices and applications.

We've also simplified our account creation architecture by removing [PREP (Provably Rootless EIP-7702 Proxy)](https://blog.biconomy.io/prep-deep-dive/)
in favor of ephemeral private keys. On each signup, Porto generates a private key for the user (on their device),
which is used to sign a cross-chain compatible [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) authorization,
and then immediately discarded for security.

This new pattern solves the core UX challenge of enabling "Create Account + Grant Permission" flows in a
single Passkey interaction. You can now authorize both sign up and spending permissions in
one user action, eliminating the complex workarounds that PREP required to make these flows
cross-chain compatible.

The ephemeral key approach maintains the same address across all chains while drastically reducing
implementation complexity. All operations happen within a secure iframe sandbox, ensuring malicious
applications never access the ephemeral private key.

## Announcing Developer Preview

<ChangelogDate date="2025-05-28" />

![Developer Preview](./porto-dev.png)

[Porto](https://ithaca.xyz/updates/porto) is our open source [TypeScript library](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto) which gives accounts the superpowers to answer these two questions. Today, we are releasing the [Porto Developer Preview](https://porto.sh), and we are excited to share that Porto is live on Base Sepolia, and coming soon to every EVM chain in production.

With Porto, you can create new accounts or upgrade existing ones by plugging into your preferred authentication layer, WebAuthn via Passkeys, or OAuth via Privy. No passwords, apps, seed phrases, private keys, or browser extensions needed.

Porto connects authentication with powerful execution capabilities⁠, solving some of the hardest problems that have haunted crypto application developers for the last years around onboarding, transacting on multiple chains, and paying predictable fees in stablecoins.

Our core principles:

- **Developer-first:** Porto works seamlessly with [Wagmi](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi) and [Viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem), the most widely used web3 frontend libraries, without any code changes.
- **Performance & cost-effectiveness:** Porto is powered by a  [reimagined account abstraction stack](https://porto.sh/contracts), which is [>50% more gas efficient](https://porto.sh/contracts/benchmarks) on payments than alternatives, and offers state of the art transaction latency.
- **Modularity:** Porto works standalone or headless, letting you enjoy the benefits of the Porto stack without changing any of the flows your users and developers love!.

Beyond crypto applications, we think Porto works well with: traditional passkey setups, existing key management systems, and crypto wallets.
