# Dialog

Porto dialog is a renderer that displays the account interface in a modal dialog.
As with everything else, Porto comes pre-configured with a default dialog renderer suitable for the user's browser of choice.
That means that you don't need to do anything to use the dialog.

## Behavior

- The dialog opens automatically when a request requires user confirmation
- The dialog closes when:
  - The user completes the requested action
  - The user clicks outside the dialog
  - The user presses the Escape key
- When the dialog closes due to a user cancellation, all pending requests will be rejected with a `UserRejectedRequestError`

## Dialog.iframe

The [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe) dialog is Porto's default rendering option.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { Porto, Dialog, Mode } from 'porto'

const porto = Porto.create({
  mode: Mode.dialog({
    renderer: Dialog.iframe() // [!code focus]
  })
})
```

## Dialog.popup

The `popup` dialog is the same as the `iframe` dialog but uses a popup window instead of an `iframe`.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { Porto, Dialog, Mode } from 'porto'

const porto = Porto.create({
  mode: Mode.dialog({
    renderer: Dialog.popup() // [!code focus]
  })
})
```
