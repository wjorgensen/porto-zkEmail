# Onboard & Discover Accounts

The ability for a user to onboard & connect their account is a core function for any Application. It allows users to perform tasks such as: making payments, authorizing subscriptions, and authenticating with offchain services.

Porto, in combination with [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh), provides a seamless way to onboard & establish a connection of a Porto Account to your Application.

To get started, you can either use [Wagmi directly](#wagmi), or a [third-party library](#third-party-libraries).

## Wagmi

Wagmi provides you with the Hooks to get started building your own Onboard & Discover Account modules.

::::steps

### Set up Wagmi

Ensure that you have set up your project with Wagmi by following the [official guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started).

### Configure Porto

Before we get started with building the functionality of the Discover Account module, we will need to set up the Wagmi configuration.

In the `config.ts` file created in the [Wagmi setup](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started), we will need to add the [`porto` connector](/sdk/wagmi/connector).

Make sure to use a [supported chain](/sdk/api/chains) for your application. In the below example, we will use Base Sepolia (`baseSepolia`).

```tsx twoslash [config.ts]
import { porto } from 'porto/wagmi' // [!code ++]
import { createConfig, http } from 'wagmi'
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [baseSepolia],
  connectors: [porto()], // [!code ++]
  transports: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: http(),
  },
})

```

### Display Sign In Button

After that, we will set up a "sign in" button so that the user can connect their account to the application.

:::code-group

<div data-title="Preview">
  <SignInButton />
</div>

<div data-title="">
  <div />
</div>

:::

:::code-group

```tsx twoslash [Example.tsx]
import * as React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useConnect } from 'wagmi'

export function Example() {
  const { connectors, connect } = useConnect()

  const connector = connectors.find(
    (connector) => connector.id === 'xyz.ithaca.porto',
  )!

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector })}>
      Sign in
    </button>
  )
}
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/snippets/wagmi/config.ts]
```

:::

### Display Account & Sign Out

After the user has signed in, you may want to display their account address and a "sign out" button.

:::code-group

<div data-title="Preview">
  <Example />
</div>

<div data-title="">
  <div />
</div>

:::

:::code-group

```tsx twoslash [Example.tsx]
import * as React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect } from 'wagmi'

export function Example() {
  const account = useAccount() // [!code ++]
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect() // [!code ++]
  
  const { connectors, connect } = useConnect()
  const connector = connectors.find(
    (connector) => connector.id === 'xyz.ithaca.porto',
  )!

  if (account.address) // [!code ++]
    return ( // [!code ++]
      <div> {/* // [!code ++] */}
        <div>{account.address.slice(0, 6)}...{account.address.slice(-4)}</div> {/* // [!code ++] */}
        <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Sign out</button> {/* // [!code ++] */}
      </div> // [!code ++]
    ) // [!code ++]

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector })}>
      Sign in
    </button>
  )
}
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts] filename="config.ts"
// [!include ~/snippets/wagmi/config.ts]
```

:::

### Done

You have now successfully set up functionality to sign in and sign out of Porto Accounts.

Check out the following examples:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/next.js)
- [Vite (React)](https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/vite-react)

::::

## Third-Party Libraries

You can also use a third-party Account Connection library to handle the onboarding & connection of Porto Accounts.

Such libraries include: [Privy](https://privy.io), [ConnectKit](https://docs.family.co/connectkit), [AppKit](https://reown.com/appkit), [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz), and [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com).

The above libraries are all built on top of Wagmi, handle all the edge cases around account connection, and provide a seamless Account Connection UX that you can use in your Application.

Once you have set up the library, make sure to inject Porto by invoking `Porto.create(){:js}`.
This will perform a side-effect to inject Porto into the Account Connection library via [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963).

```tsx twoslash [config.ts]
import { Porto } from 'porto'
Porto.create()
```
