# Fee Sponsoring

This guide will demonstrate how you can leverage Fee Sponsoring in your Application to cover
fees for your users.

## Template

We will base this guide off the following template:

```bash
pnpx gitpick ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/sponsoring-vite
```

:::note
We also have a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) example at:

```bash
pnpx gitpick ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/sponsoring-next.js
```

:::

## Steps

::::steps

### Connect Account

Follow the [Onboard & Discover Accounts](/sdk/guides/discover-accounts) guide to get this set up.

### Set up Merchant Account

Run the following command to onboard a new Porto Merchant (Sponsor) Account.

```sh
pnpx porto onboard -a
```

Place the address and private key of the merchant account into the `.dev.vars` file.

```sh
MERCHANT_ADDRESS=0x...
MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

### Set up Merchant RPC Server

Next, we will set up our Merchant RPC Server at the `/rpc` endpoint of our app.
For this example, we will use a Cloudflare Worker, however, you could also use a
server framework of your choice (Next.js, Deno, Express, etc).
See the [`MerchantRpc` API reference](/sdk/api/merchantRpc/requestHandler).

```ts
import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'
import { MerchantRpc } from 'porto/server'

export default {
  fetch: MerchantRpc.requestHandler({
    address: env.MERCHANT_ADDRESS,
    base: '/rpc',
    key: env.MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY,
    // Optionally handle which requests should be sponsored.
    // sponsor(request) {
    //   return true
    // },
  }),
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>
```

:::note
If your server is at a different location to your app, you will need to pass the URL
to it on `Porto.create(){:js}`.

```ts twoslash  
import { Porto } from 'porto'

const porto = await Porto.create({
  merchantRpcUrl: 'https://myapi.com/rpc'
})
```

:::

### Done

That's it! Once you have a server set up at the `/rpc` path of your app (or another remote URL), Porto will automatically
detect it and route through this endpoint for future calls to perform (and sponsor) a transaction.
