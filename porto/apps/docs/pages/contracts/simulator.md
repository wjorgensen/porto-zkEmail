# Simulator
The Simulator is a versatile utility designed to help offchain services and RPC servers obtain accurate gas estimates for intents efficiently. 

It functions like an advanced multicall, enabling sophisticated operations such as searching for optimal `combinedGas` values, generating custom execution traces, and providing clearer error messages for transaction reverts.
It uses the primitive [simulateExecute](/contracts/orchestrator#simulation) function exposed by the orchestrator, and adds custom logic on top of it.

Developers have the flexibility to utilize the default `Simulator` provided by Ithaca or deploy a custom one tailored to their specific needs. 

Simulators operate without any special onchain privileges and any simulator can be used with any Orchestrator instance.

## State Override Convention

Certain simulation modes, especially those designed to generate detailed logs for tools like `eth_simulateV1`, depend on specific state overrides to operate correctly.

A general principle for enabling special simulation behaviors, such as skipping signature verification checks, involves checking the native token balance of `msg.sender`. If this balance is `type(uint256).max`, it signals a trusted simulation environment where certain validation steps can be relaxed.

- **For `simulateV1Logs`:**
    - The [simulateExecute](/contracts/orchestrator#simulation) function, when invoked with `isStateOverride = true`, requires its direct caller (`msg.sender`) to possess a native token balance equal to `type(uint256).max`.
    - When `simulateV1Logs` calls the Orchestrator, the Simulator contract acts as the `msg.sender`.
    - **Crucially, for `simulateV1Logs` to successfully produce a non-reverting trace, the Simulator contract's native token balance must be externally set to `type(uint256).max` *before* calling `simulateV1Logs`.**
    - Failure to meet this condition will typically cause the Orchestrator to revert with `StateOverrideError()`, which is then propagated by the Simulator.

**Paymaster Considerations:**
If an Intent utilizes a paymaster, the simulation might also need to bypass paymaster signature verification.

In this scenario, the Orchestrator is the `msg.sender` to the paymaster contract. Consequently, the Orchestrator's balance must also be set to `type(uint256).max` to facilitate this.

Developers creating paymasters should ensure their contracts can skip signature verification when called by an entity with a maximum balance (signifying a trusted simulation context) to maintain compatibility with the Simulator.

## Endpoints
### `simulateGasUsed`
- **Signature:**
  ```solidity
  function simulateGasUsed(
    address oc,
    bool overrideCombinedGas,
    bytes calldata encodedIntent
  ) public payable virtual returns (uint256 gasUsed);
  ```
- **Description:**
  This function simulates the gas usage for a single encoded Intent. It calls the `simulateExecute` function on the specified Orchestrator contract with `isStateOverride` set to `false`.
  If the underlying simulation within the Orchestrator fails, this function will revert.
- **Usage:**
  - **Parameters:**
    - `oc`: Address of the Orchestrator contract.
    - `overrideCombinedGas`: Boolean indicating how `combinedGas` is handled:
      - If `true`: The `combinedGas` field in the `encodedIntent` is overridden to `type(uint256).max` for the simulation. This helps determine the raw gas cost without constraints from the Intent's specified gas limit.
      - If `false`: The `combinedGas` value from the `encodedIntent` is respected.
    - `encodedIntent`: The ABI-encoded [Intent](/contracts/orchestrator#intents)
  - **Returns:**
    - `gasUsed`: The amount of gas consumed by the simulated execution. This is extracted from the `SimulationPassed(uint256 gasUsed)` revert data from the Orchestrator.
  - **Reverts:**
    - If the simulation fails (e.g., due to an error in Intent logic or insufficient gas if `overrideCombinedGas` is `false`), it reverts with the Orchestrator's error.

### `simulateCombinedGas`
- **Signature:**
  ```solidity
  function simulateCombinedGas(
      address oc,
      bool isPrePayment,
      uint8 paymentPerGasPrecision,
      uint256 paymentPerGas,
      uint256 combinedGasIncrement,
      bytes calldata encodedIntent
  ) public payable virtual returns (uint256 gasUsed, uint256 combinedGas);
  ```
- **Description:**
  This function simulates an Intent's execution to iteratively find the minimum `combinedGas` value required for it to pass successfully. The process involves two main stages:
  1.  **Baseline Simulation:** 
      - Performs a primary simulation run by calling the Orchestrator's `simulateExecute` function.
      - `isStateOverride` is set to `false`.
      - `combinedGasOverride` is set to `type(uint256).max`.
      - This initial run establishes a baseline `gasUsed` for the Intent.
  2.  **Iterative Search:**
      - Iteratively increases the `combinedGas` field in a copy of the Intent.
      - Starts from `baseline_gasUsed + original_Intent.combinedGas`.
      - Associated payment amounts (`prePaymentAmount`, `totalPaymentAmount`) are adjusted accordingly in each iteration.
      - Continues until a call to the Orchestrator's `simulateExecute` (with `isStateOverride = false` and no `combinedGasOverride`) succeeds by reverting with `SimulationPassed`.
- **Usage:**
  - **Parameters:**
    - `oc`: Address of the Orchestrator contract.
    - `isPrePayment`: Boolean indicating how payment is handled:
        - If `true`: The gas-based payment is added to `prePaymentAmount` (and `totalPaymentAmount`).
        - If `false`: The gas-based payment is added only to `totalPaymentAmount`.
    - `paymentPerGasPrecision`: Defines precision for `paymentPerGas`. 
        - Example: If `paymentPerGas` is in Gwei, `paymentToken` has 18 decimals, and you want `paymentPerGas` to represent units with 9 decimal places of precision, this field would be `9`.
        - Payment amount is calculated as: `gas * paymentPerGas / (10 ** paymentPerGasPrecision)`.
    - `paymentPerGas`: Amount of `paymentToken` added to Intent's payment fields per unit of gas.
    - `combinedGasIncrement`: Basis points value for `combinedGas` increment step (e.g., `100` for 1%, `10000` for 100%).
        - `combinedGas` is updated in each iteration by: `current_combinedGas * combinedGasIncrement / 10000`
        
        - Ensure this value is greater than `10000` (e.g., `10100` for a 1% increment) to guarantee `combinedGas` increases.
    - `encodedIntent`: The ABI-encoded [Intent](/contracts/orchestrator#intents)
    
  - **Returns:**
    - `gasUsed`: Gas consumed in the first successful simulation identified during the iterative search (extracted from `SimulationPassed` revert data).
    - `combinedGas`: The `combinedGas` value from the Intent that resulted in the first successful simulation.
  - **Reverts:**
    - If the initial baseline simulation (with maximum `combinedGas`) fails.
    - If a `PaymentError` is encountered during the iterative search (increasing `combinedGas` and payments won't resolve this).

### `simulateV1Logs`
- **Signature:**
  ```solidity
  function simulateV1Logs(
      address oc,
      bool isPrePayment,
      uint8 paymentPerGasPrecision,
      uint256 paymentPerGas,
      uint256 combinedGasIncrement,
      uint256 combinedGasVerificationOffset,
      bytes calldata encodedIntent
  ) public payable virtual returns (uint256 gasUsed, uint256 combinedGas);
  ```
- **Description:**
  - Extends the functionality of `simulateCombinedGas`.
  - After determining `combinedGas` and `gasUsed` iteratively, it introduces a `combinedGasVerificationOffset`.
  - A final simulation run is performed by calling `simulateExecute` on the Orchestrator with `isStateOverride` set to `true`.
  - Goal: Generate a successful, non-reverting simulation trace compatible with tools like `eth_simulateV1` for detailed execution log retrieval.
  - Payment amounts in the Intent are updated based on the determined `combinedGas` (including the offset).
- **Usage:**
  - State override requirements are detailed [here](#state-override-convention).
  - **Parameters:**
    - `combinedGasVerificationOffset`: A static gas amount added to the `combinedGas` value found by the iterative search. This helps account for minor gas variations (e.g., with P256 signature schemes).
    - All other parameters function identically to those in [`simulateCombinedGas`](#simulatecombinedgas).

  - **Returns:**
    - `gasUsed`: Gas consumed during the final verification run.
    - `combinedGas`: Final `combinedGas` used in the verification run.
  - **Reverts:**
    - If any underlying simulation step fails.
    - If the necessary state override for the `Simulator` contract's balance is not in place, the final call to Orchestrator will likely revert with `StateOverrideError()`.
