# Security Fixes Applied

## 1. Email Replay Protection

### Problem
- Emails could be reused after service restart
- Multiple users could use the same email verification

### Solution
- Added SQLite database to persist email verification history
- Each email/code combination can only be used once
- Database checks prevent replay attacks across service restarts
- Old pending verifications are automatically cleaned up after 30 minutes

### Implementation
- `emailDatabase.js`: Persistent storage for email verifications
- Hash email addresses and codes for privacy
- Check database before processing any email
- Atomic operations ensure consistency

## 2. WebAuthn Passkey Implementation

### Problem
- Passkey creation was simulated, not using real WebAuthn API

### Solution
- Implemented real WebAuthn credential creation
- Falls back to mock passkey for development environments
- Uses platform authenticator with biometric verification
- Requires user verification and resident key

### Implementation
- Uses standard WebAuthn API
- Proper RP ID configuration for localhost
- Graceful fallback for unsupported environments
- Credential ID stored for future authentication

## Testing

1. **Email Replay Test**:
   - Send verification email
   - Reply to verify
   - Try to reuse the same email - should be rejected
   - Restart service and try again - still rejected

2. **Passkey Test**:
   - Complete email verification
   - Click "Create Passkey"
   - Should prompt for biometric/PIN
   - Falls back to mock if not supported

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are hashed in database
- Verification codes are hashed
- No sensitive data stored in plain text
- Automatic cleanup of old verifications
- WebAuthn uses platform authenticator for maximum security
